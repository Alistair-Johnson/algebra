# algebra

## the vision

This repo represents an attempt to unify the basic algebraic type
classes from [Spire](http://github.com/non/spire) and
[Algebird](http://github.com/twitter/algebird). By targeting just
these type classes, the hope is that we can distribute a package with
no dependencies that works with Scala 2.9 and 2.10+.

## what we have so far

This repo has been seeded with most of the contents of
`spire.algebra`. Over the next week or two we will be removing
"extraneous" type classes and adding additional ones as
needed. Discussions over removals and additions shoudl take place on
pull requests.
